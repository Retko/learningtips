                <p class="uvod">Good note-taking is crucial to academic success.  </p>

                <h6>First, let's debunk 5 myths about note-taking.</h6>
                <ol>
                    <li>  Note-taking is unnecessary when the instructor has hand-out or lecture notes for you.
                    </li>
                    <li>   Write down everything you could while taking notes.
                    </li>
                    <li>   Note-taking method or format is very important.
                    </li>
                    <li>     Once done it's done (after note-taking), forget all about it until exam time.
                    </li>
                    <li> Paper and pen seems more "natural" or "typing does not help consolidate my thinking as much as writing".
                    </li>


                </ol>
                <h6>ALL WRONG. </h6>

                <p class="uvod">The truth is:</p>

                <h6>Myth 1</h6>
                <p>Instructor's hand-out or notes are simply like books in a library, the knowledge has not been transferred to you even if hand-outs are in your hand.  Note-taking is "write to learn".</p>

                <h6>Myth 2</h6>


                <p> a)  It's an impossible task; <br>
                    b) More importantly, not every word is equal, that is, something is more important than the rest. <br>
                    c)  We're not passive copy machines. </p>



                <h6>Myth 3 </h6>
                <p>Cornell Method is widely acknowledged as the best note-taking method, which structure-wise divides note-taking space into 3 areas with 2 columns, namely, left column for cues, right column for note body and at its bottom, a summary.  It's excellent but you don't want to be rigid. And digital note-taking can produce better results if you do it right. </p>

                <p>With regard to Outline of multi-layered structures, it may look sort of nice BUT don't let appearance fool you. If you're writing a business proposal or a legal document for others' consumption, yes, format counts but not note-taking. It is not recommended during lecture because your short memory (working memory) is limited, such complex structures impede learning (information encoding). So, let it be "flat" while not letting key ideas/concepts slip...</p>

                <h6>Myth 4</h6>
                <p>If we really have to be "lazy", at least taking good notes and immediately review the notes for important courses (immediately, meaning within 24 hours).</p>

                <h6>Myth 5</h6>
                <p>For the two most important processes of learning when it comes to note-taking, the note-taking itself and the review, for the first process, note-taking, either form does not make any difference in terms of learning outcome, but for the second important process of review, paper and pen approach is inferior for a couple of reasons:  </p>

                <p>
                a) hard to read<br>
                b) difficult to add substantive additional information<br>
                c) impossible to move "idea" around, that is, it's rigid.<br>
                d) hard to share your notes with peers for collaboration or offer of help. <br>
                e) extremely difficult or impossible for future re-use or reference<br><br></p>

               

                <p>Having said that, for subjects/courses, for instance, engineering or math courses, that have tons of equations, diagrams, charts etc. our old friend, pen and paper is still most efficient and effective.
